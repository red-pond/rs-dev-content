### Understanding Automatic Sidebar Navigation, Naming & Ordering

The Page Contents and [Site Contents](http://riverscapes.northarrowresearch.com/Technical_Reference/jekyll_toolbox.html#site-table-of-contents) are auto populated. Page contents are based on your use of headings (e.g. `## Heading 1, ### Heading 2, #### Heading 3...`) in your mark down. The Site Contents are based on the [front matter](http://riverscapes.northarrowresearch.com/Technical_Reference/jekyll_toolbox.html#front-matter) and [page sorting](http://riverscapes.northarrowresearch.com/Technical_Reference/jekyll_toolbox.html#page-sorting)  you populate at top of your page.
