<Image float="left" src="/images/tools/reportcard_200.png" />If a [tool in the RC Tool Listing](/Tools/#riverscapes-compliant-tools) has a badge in the Status column (e.g.  <Image noWrap src="/images/tools/grade/TRL_3_32p.png" />), and that grade is hyperlinked, it has been scored by the RC with a Report Card by the RC Technical Committee. 

Report Cards provide:
- A summary assessment of [tool-grade](/Tools/discrimination.html#tool-grade) (e.g. research-grade  <Image noWrap src="/images/tools/grade/TRL_4_32p.png" />) and [Riverscapes Compliance](/Tools/#riverscapes-compliant-tools)  <Image noWrap src="/images/rc/RiverscapesCompliant_24.png" /> or [Pending Riverscapes Compliance](/Tools/#tools-pending-riverscapes-compliance) <Image noWrap src="/images/rc/RiverscapesCompliantPending_28.png" />.
