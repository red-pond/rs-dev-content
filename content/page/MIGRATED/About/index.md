## More Elaborate Background

This half hour video is based on [Joe Wheaton](http://joewheaton.org)'s talk at a workshop in Lyon, France in December of 2019 on Regionalized Fluvial Geomorphology (see [original slides](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/338225952_Riverscapes_Consortium_to_Leverage_Advances_in_Other_Regions_in_your_Regionalization)). It lays out some of the key concepts and part of the motivation for the Riverscapes Consortium and why we are developing data standards and workflows.
